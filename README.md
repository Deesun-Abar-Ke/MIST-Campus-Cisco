# MIST-Campus-Cisco
In Bangladesh, the integration of smart technologies into educational institutions is becoming
increasingly essential to enhance learning environments and administrative efficiency. Traditional
campuses often face challenges such as inefficient resource management, limited interdepartmental
communication, and inadequate security measures. The Military Institute of Science
and Technology (MIST) recognizes these challenges and is committed to transforming its campus
into a smart campus. This initiative aims to implement advanced technologies, including IoT
devices and automated systems, to improve operational efficiency, security, and the overall
educational experience. Our project, 'MIST Campus', is designed to highlight and enhance the
existing smart solutions at MIST while introducing new features such as RFID-based access
control. This project demonstrates how a structured, technology-driven approach can make campus
operations more secure, efficient, and scalable.
